Juan Posadas' Personal Site
================================

*View this [page live](http://stanford.edu/~jposadas).*

This is an attempt to build a personal website to display information about myself and current as well as past projects, and a place to showcase some of the work I've done over the past years. Thanks for looking at the source code for my site. If you have any questions, please email me at <jposadas@stanford.edu>.
